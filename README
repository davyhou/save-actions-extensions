This project contains plugins and features for an Eclipse menu contribution to apply Save Actions to a group of Java files.

This project can be built from the root pom with standard Maven commands, e.g.,
    $> mvn clean package integration-test

When importing these projects into Eclipse, you should be able to import them as Existing Maven Projects (with the m2e plugin). This should create the appropriate .classpath and .project files.
You may need to delete the timezra.eclipse.apply_save_actions.tests project from the workspace (but not from disk) and then re-import it as a General -> Existing Project after the .classpath and .project files have been created. This might have something to do with its being a fragment.
